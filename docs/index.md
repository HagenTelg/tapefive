# tapefive

A typed, high-level Python API around LNFL/LBLRTM: build & validate TAPE5, run the binaries, and parse outputs into `xarray` with clear, early errors.

> LNFL/LBLRTM and the AER Line File are external prerequisites. See **Install**.

## What you can do
- Define atmospheres & spectroscopy inputs with validators
- Generate TAPE5 safely
- Run LNFL/LBLRTM
- Load TAPE7/TAPE12 as `xarray.Dataset`

See the **Quickstart** to get a feel for the workflow.
